# Intro

Let's discover **SFDocs in less than 5 minutes**

## Why SF Docs?

The plugin borns from the necessity of having documentation of your SObjects, classes, profiles, etc. at hand outside of Salesforce, without having to review the repository source code and asking Developers or Architects to maintain documentation manually in order to audit the actual configuration of the Organization.

You will be able to run the commands at any moment, but we recommend to automate this execution in your CI/CD pipeline on `main` / `master` / `production` deployments.
